The cancer like lung, prostrate, and colorectal cancers contribute up to 45% of cancer deaths. So it is very important to detect or predict before it reaches to serious stages. If cancer predicted in its early stages, then it helps to save the lives. Statistical methods are generally used for classification of risks of cancer i.e. high risk or low risk. Sometime it becomes difficult to handle the complex interactions of highdimensional data.

## Objectives

> *Machine learning techniques* can be used to overcome these drawbacks which are cause due to the high dimensions of the data. So in this project I am using machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of getting cancer.

## Algorithms Used

The Algorithms used are : 

	* Naive Bayes
	* decision tree
	* kNN
	* kMeans clustering
	* RandomForestClassifier
